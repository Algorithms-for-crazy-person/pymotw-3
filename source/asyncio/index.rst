 asyncio --- Asynchronous I/O, event loop, and concurrency tools
=================================================================

.. module:: asyncio
   :synopsis: Asynchronous I/O, event loop, and concurrency tools

:Purpose: An asynchronous I/O and concurrency framework.

The :mod:`asyncio` module provides tools for building concurrent
applications using coroutines. While the :mod:`threading` module
implements concurrency through application threads and
:mod:`multiprocessing` implements concurrency using system processes,
:mod:`asyncio` uses a single-threaded, single-process approach in
which parts of an application cooperate to switch tasks explicitly at
optimal times. Most often this context switching occurs when the
program would otherwise block waiting to read or write data, but
:mod:`asyncio` also includes support for scheduling code to run at a
specific future time, to enable one coroutine to wait for another to
complete, for handling system signals, and for recognizing other
events that may be reasons for an application to change what it is
working on.

   coroutines

.. note::

   :mod:`asyncio` is still a *provisional* module. The API may change
   in backwards-incompatible ways, and the entire module may be
   removed, though that is much less likely.

        - scheduling based on the clock
            - call_soon -- asyncio_call_soon.py
            - call_later -- asyncio_call_later.py
                - schedule two callbacks out of order using different sleep times, and have them executed in the opposite order they are scheduled

    - advanced topics
        - connecting with SSL -- asyncio_echo_server_ssl.py and asyncio_echo_client_ssl.py
        - control flow
          - waiting for background tasks from within a coroutine -- asyncio_background_task.py
          - waiting for a task with a timeout -- asyncio_wait_task_timeout.py
          - using wait(), gather(), and as_completed() to wait for groups of background tasks
            - asyncio_wait_coroutines.py, asyncio_wait_tasks.py, asyncio_wait_task_timeout.py
            - asyncio_gather.py
            - asyncio_as_completed.py
        - run_until_complete() vs. run_forever()
        - stopping the event loop programmatically -- asyncio_stop.py

        - looking up a hostname -- asyncio_getaddrinfo.py
    - enabling debugging -- asyncio_debug.py
    - aiohttp third-party module
    - not sure about
        - pausing transport production in a protocol?
        - using existing sockets?
        - alternate event loops, esp. for Windows
        - waiting for a background task from within a protocol
